# Ultrasonic-Radar
Ultrasonic Radar is an Arduino based radar used to detect the stationary and moving objects using ultrasonic sensor SR-04. 

## Hardware Required 

- Arduino UNO
- SR-04 Ultrasonic sensor
- D-type usb cable
- Jumper wires
- Servo Motor SG90

## Agenda 

- Ultrasonic Radar is helping us to safe guard and keeping track of the objects moving in and around the defined circumference. 
- The hardware can be installed in the defense areas to patrol and monitor the sensitive areas. 
- Since there are lot of invaders in many areas so ultrasonic radar can help us to track down those elements. 
- It can also helps us to track down the predator animals moving from forest areas to village areas, thus keeping human life safe.
- It can also helps us to count the frequency of movement of a certain object kept in an observational area.
